#Summarize briefly how this system could be tested.

1) On page load displaying all the data for all mutation types and all chromosomes.
2) If only mutation type is changed, then updating the view for that mutation type with all the chromosomes.
3) If only chromosome is changed, then updating the view for the chromosome selected and all the mutation types.
4) If both mutation type and chromosome changed, then performing AND logical operator between chromosome selection and mutation type selection and displaying the result.
5) If no data is present, then just displaying the text "No data is available for the selection"
